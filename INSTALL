This file desribes how to get the Leprechaun mud library up and running. The
author assumes that you have already retrieved and unpacked the Leprechaun
distribution. If you checked Leprechaun out of the Subversion repository, you
may want to remove all ".svn" directories first so that they cannot be accessed
from within the mud.

You should be able to locate any additional resources required from DGD's home
page:

  http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/

Now, follow these steps:

  1. Get a recent version of DGD's experimental branch.

  2. Copy the directories "mud/kernel" and "mud/include/kernel" from the DGD
     distribution to the corresponding locations in the Leprechaun "mud"
     directory.

  3. Edit the base directory in the configuration file "mud.dgd" so that it
     points to the Leprechaun "mud" directory as installed on your system.

  4. Start DGD using Leprechaun's configuration file. Log in as "admin" on the
     binary port and grant access to the "Game" user. Restart DGD and log in
     on the telnet port as a normal user.
