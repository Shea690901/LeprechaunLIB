                 An overview of the system library in Leprechaun


1. Object numbers

The object_number() function returns a unique, non-zero number for the object
argument. Zero is returned for light-weight objects. Non-zero object numbers
can be passed to the find_object() function to find the object again.


2. Inventory system

The system library provides an object inventory system similar to that of
LPmud. Object movement can be vetoed by both the environment being moved into
and the object being moved.


3. Middle-weight objects

Middle-weight objects are specially managed light-weight objects. A
light-weight object can be promoted to a middle-weight object by moving it into
an environment using the move_object() function. Light-weight and middle-weight
objects cannot serve as environments themselves.

Each middle-weight object is assigned a unique object number that can be
retrieved with the object_number() function. The object number can be used as a
work-around for the automatic duplication of middle-weight objects. The object
retains its object name on the form "master#-1".

Middle-weight objects can have call-outs.


3. Further restrictions on use of objects

In addition to the inheritable objects already hidden by the kernel library,
the system library hides clonable and light-weight master objects. User code
cannot find the master objects or call functions in them.


4. Restrictions on undefined functions

Non-inheritable objects cannot have undefined functions. Undefined functions
cannot be privately inherited.


5. Atomic object creation

The compile_object(), clone_object(), and new_object() functions are atomic.
This means that any error raised during object compilation or initialization
causes the creation to be undone, including errors raised by the create()
function.


6. Creator function arguments

The clone_object() and new_object() functions accept any number of extra
arguments. The extra arguments are passed along to the create() function of the
newly created clone or light-weight object.
