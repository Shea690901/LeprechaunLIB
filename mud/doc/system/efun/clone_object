NAME
        clone_object - clone an object

SYNOPSIS
        atomic object clone_object(string master, mixed arguments...)

DESCRIPTION
        Create a clone of the specified master object. The new object is
        returned. It has the same owner as the current object. Clones have
        names of the form "master#number", with a positive number.

        The create() function will be called in the cloned object immediately.
        Any additional arguments specified are passed on to the create()
        function.

ACCESS
        The current object must have read access to the file of the master
        object.

ERRORS
        If the number of existing objects is equal to the value of the
        ST_OTABSIZE field of the array returned by status(), where ST_OTABSIZE
        is defined in the include file <status.h>, attempting to clone a new
        object will raise an error.
