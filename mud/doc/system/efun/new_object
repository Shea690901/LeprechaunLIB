NAME
        new_object - create a new light-weight object

SYNOPSIS
        atomic object new_object(string master, mixed arguments...)
        atomic object new_object(object obj)

DESCRIPTION
        Create a new light-weight instance of the specified object. The new
        object is returned. It will have the same owner as this object.
        Light-weight objects have names of the form "master#-1". They are
        garbage-collected and cannot be explicitly destructed.

        In the first form of calling this function, the first argument is the
        master object to use when creating the new object. The argument will
        first be normalized as a path relative to the current object. The
        create() function will be called in the new object immediately. Any
        additional arguments will be passed on to the create() function.

        In the second form, the argument is itself a light-weight object to be
        copied. The create() function will not be called in this case.

ACCESS
        Unless the argument is itself a light-weight object to be copied, the
        current object must have read access to the file of the master object.
