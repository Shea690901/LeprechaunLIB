NAME
        move_object - move object to destination

SYNOPSIS
        atomic void move_object(object destination)

DESCRIPTION
        Move this object to the specified destination. The destination must be
        either nil or a persistent object. Unless the destination is nil, the
        allow_move() function is first called in it. If that function returns
        false, the move is vetoed and an error is raised. Otherwise, the
        destination becomes the new environment of this object, and this object
        becomes a part of the inventory of the destination.

        If this object is a light-weight object, it will be promoted to a
        middle-weight object. Middle-weight objects are light-weight objects
        that are specially managed by the system so that they can replace
        persistent objects for some uses. Middle-weight objects have unique
        object numbers and can have callouts. They retain their light-weight
        object names on the form "master#-1".

        Middle-weight objects can be disposed of by moving them to a nil
        environment. This demotes them back to light-weight objects so that
        they can be garbage-collected.

ERRORS
        Unless the destination is nil or a persistent object, an error is
        raised. An error is also raised if the allow_move() function called in
        the destination returns false.
