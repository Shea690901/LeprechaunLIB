NAME
        find_object - find an object

SYNOPSIS
        object find_object(string name)
        object find_object(int number)

DESCRIPTION
        Find an object by name or number. Either the object, if found, or nil
        is returned. In the first form, the argument is first normalized as a
        path relative to this object. The normalized path is then used to find
        the object. In the second form, the object is found by number. 

        Master objects with an ancestor directory named "data", "lib", or "obj"
        cannot be found with this function. Middle-weight objects can only be
        found by number.
