NAME
        move_object - move an object to another environment

SYNOPSIS
        atomic int move_object(object obj, object environment)

DESCRIPTION
        Move the specified object to a new environment. The functions
        allow_move() and allow_enter() will be called in the object and the
        environment, respectively. If any of these functions returns false, the
        move is vetoed and this function returns false. Otherwise, the object
        moves to the environment and this function returns true.

        If the object is a light-weight object, it will be promoted to a
        middle-weight object. Middle-weight objects are light-weight objects
        that are specially managed by the system so that they can replace
        persistent objects for some uses. Middle-weight objects have unique
        object numbers and can have callouts. They retain their light-weight
        object names on the form "master#-1".

        The environment must be either nil or a persistent object. Middle-
        weight objects can be disposed of by moving them to a nil environment.
        This demotes them back to light-weight objects so that they can be
        garbage-collected.
