NAME
        find_object - find an object

SYNOPSIS
        object find_object(mixed obj)

DESCRIPTION
        Find an object by name or number. If the argument is a string, it will
        first be normalized as a path relative to this object. Either the
        object, if found, or nil is returned.

	Master objects with an ancestor directory named "data", "lib", or "obj"
        cannot be found with this function. Managed light-weight objects can
        only be found by number.
