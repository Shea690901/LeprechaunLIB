NAME
        remove_call_out - remove a delayed call to a function

SYNOPSIS
        mixed remove_call_out(int handle)

DESCRIPTION
        Remove the callout associated with the specified handle. The delay
        after which the function would have been called is returned. The delay
        is an integer or a floating point number, depending on how the callout
        was started. If there is no scheduled call associated with the handle
        in the current object, -1 is returned.

        The delayed calls of an object can be retrieved using the status()
        function. Light-weight objects cannot have callouts, but middle-weight
        objects can. Light-weight objects can be promoted to middle-weight
        objects using the move_object() function.
