NAME
        promote - promote to middle-weight object

SYNOPSIS
        void promote()

DESCRIPTION
        This function is called in a light-weight object when it is promoted to
        a middle-weight object. The promotion occurs when the light-weight
        object is moved into a persistent environment using the move_object()
        function.

        Since object movement is atomic, objects can raise an error in
        promote() to undo their promotion.
