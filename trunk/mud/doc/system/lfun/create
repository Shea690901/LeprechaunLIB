NAME
        create - initialize object

SYNOPSIS
        void create()
        void create(mixed arguments...)

DESCRIPTION
        This function is called when an object is initialized. The first form
        is used for master objects, and the second for clones and light-weight
        objects. The arguments passed to this function in the second form are
        the extra arguments specified for the clone_object() or new_object()
        call that created this object.

        Since object creation is atomic, objects can raise an error in create()
        to undo their creation.
